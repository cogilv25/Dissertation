Extensive literature exists for solutions that use L-Systems to produce plants and trees:
- The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants (http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop.pdf) introduces the concept of L-Systems as a a text rewriting algorithm, presenting many examples of how they can be used with the combination of a turtle renderer to produce beautiful visuals of plants and trees. Further it introduces multiple types of L-System including parametric L-Systems where parameters or variables can be associated with the symbols within the string being operated on and thus arithmetic operations can be performed upon these values in rewriting rules, and stochastic L-Systems where a symbol is added to the alphabet to represent a random value which can be used to add variation to generated plants.
- Another paper uses genetic algorithms alongside L-Systems to produce plants for use in games. The initial parameters for each L-System are generated and then the L-Systems are allowed to develop with a user defined fitness function being used to determine which plants will pass their genome on to the next generation. This continues until a user-defined number of generations is simulated. (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-90418-4_2)
- Another paper implemented physically based skeletol animation of plant models generated by L-Systems that coulc reproduce natural effects like wind and gravity. (https://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/OldWeb/MastersProjects/MSc09/Hampshire/thesis.pdf)
- produced L-Systems that simulate the death of a plant (https://www.niclab.mx/portal/sites/default/files/SemanticDeathInPlantSimulationUsingLindenmayerSystems_0.pdf)
- and generation of 3D plants using L-Systems (https://www.scitepress.org/PublishedPapers/2009/17853/pdf/index.html).
Additionally there has been some preliminary work in other areas:
- level generation (https://www.jait.us/uploadfile/2024/JAIT-V15N2-276.pdf)
- generation of cities (https://web.archive.org/web/20060114082225/http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~pmueller/documents/procedural_modeling_of_cities__siggraph2001.pdf) (thereâ€™s another..)
- volumetric spaceship generation (https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3520304.3528775?casa_token=7MOs98nNai0AAAAA:uSQgCc8x3ttin0TiPVI1fvd0pSMtNW2dfx58NTSt3GDJ9bWYb59Fse3slkaIeJgihCmeyD9tb-hsBQ)
- and generation of river deltas (https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/322445609.pdf#page=132).

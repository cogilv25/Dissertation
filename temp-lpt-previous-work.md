Extensive literature exists for solutions that use L-Systems to produce plants and trees:
- The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants (“) outlines the 
- combined genetic algorithms to evolve plants (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-90418-4_2)
- implemented dynamic animation of the growth of plants using L-Systems to produce key frames and interpolating between these (https://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/OldWeb/MastersProjects/MSc09/Hampshire/thesis.pdf)
- produced L-Systems that simulate the death of a plant (https://www.niclab.mx/portal/sites/default/files/SemanticDeathInPlantSimulationUsingLindenmayerSystems_0.pdf)
- and generation of 3D plants using L-Systems (https://www.scitepress.org/PublishedPapers/2009/17853/pdf/index.html).
Additionally there has been some preliminary work in other areas:
- level generation (https://www.jait.us/uploadfile/2024/JAIT-V15N2-276.pdf)
- generation of cities (https://web.archive.org/web/20060114082225/http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~pmueller/documents/procedural_modeling_of_cities__siggraph2001.pdf) (there’s another..)
- volumetric spaceship generation (https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3520304.3528775?casa_token=7MOs98nNai0AAAAA:uSQgCc8x3ttin0TiPVI1fvd0pSMtNW2dfx58NTSt3GDJ9bWYb59Fse3slkaIeJgihCmeyD9tb-hsBQ)
- and generation of river deltas (https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/322445609.pdf#page=132).

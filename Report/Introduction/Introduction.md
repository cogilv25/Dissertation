# Introduction
Procedural generation is an important field for solving the problem of creating huge amounts of content of increasingly higher quality with each passing year in the computer games industry(Hendrikx, Meijer, Veldon, & Iosup, 2013, p. 2). Many techniques exist such as cellular automata, wave function collapse, machine learning, and rewriting-systems, this work will focus on a specific family of re-writing systems called Lindenmayer Systems and it's derivatives. The aim of the project is to explore using L-Systems to generate a multitude of content classes where there appears to be limited prior research and there is reason to expect favourable results given the nature of L-Systems. The intended outcome is to create algorithms capable of generating assets for computer games using L-Systems which can be used in commercial games and further developed and improved upon.

## Background
### L-Systems
Lindenmayer Systems were first proposed as a way of modelling the development of plant like structures by Aristid Lindenmayer in 1968. The simplest L-Systems are called DOL-Systems and are both deterministic and context-free. An L-System consists of an alphabet (the set of symbols allowed by the system), an axiom (a set of symbols from the alphabet which are used as the initial state of the system), and a set of production rules where each rule is a translation of one symbol to one or more new symbols. L-systems are typically applied to strings where the symbols are characters within that string.

### Rendering
There are 2 ways to produce a rendered image the first is to directly interpret the L-System output as an image and the second is to use the L-System to generate an intermediary representation which is then further processed by a rendering function to produce the final image. The second of these is the most commonly used as it reduces the complexity of the system allowing it to use whatever format is most appropriate with the rendering function being modified to parse it as needed. The most common method is ausing a turtle renderer to "walk" a generated string produced by the L-System maintaining and modifying some internal state such as it's position and orientation based on the symbols it encounters as well as producing the final rendered image (Graphical Applications of L-Systems).

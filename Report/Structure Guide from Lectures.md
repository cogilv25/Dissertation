# Introduction
## Background
Gap in Literature
Research aims, objectives
Hypothesis / research questions
Significance / justification
Overview of structure / "lead-in to literature review"

# Literature Review
evaluate existing research
compare different studies (do authors agree / disagree)
assess limitations of studies (bias, methodology...)
identify research gap
how my study is valuable and contributes
## Conclusion
how does my study contribute, how does literature affect my plan / design

# Methodology
research design / approach (qualitative, quantitative, mixed)
Justify research approach
Tools and Techniques
Development Methodology and justification
Test strategy and methods
Data collection methods
Data handling legislation, ethics, storage (NA??)
Data analysis methods
Limitations of methodology

# Results
Restatement of research questions, hypothesis, project intent
Explanation of intended structure
Development review
Presentation of product and testing without any analysis or comments
finish up with usability testing highlighting key points made by users.
Summary of key findings
Avoid interpretations or drawing conclusions

# Analysis - Critical Reflection
Restatement of research questions, hypothesis, project intent
Interpretation of findings in relation to research questions
Making sense of findings results (discussion about findings)
How findings compare to existing literature
Implications of the results
Identification of patterns or relationships (underlying causes, mechanisms)
Connect to literature review - consistent / divergent from past studies ( Why might this be? )
Have you added a fresh perspective to the research area
Limitations of the research - bias, constraints, approaches taken
## Future Work - possible future developments
Key research takeaway, explicitly link to research questions / project intent

# Personal Reflection
First person style
Restate project motivation
evaluate what was learnt
acknowledge challenges and growth
link personal development to future goals - how has the project influenced your future
Show critical self-awareness - reflect honestly on strengths and weaknesses

conclude with ## Lessons Learned

One of the possible implementation of [[Re-Write Rule]]s for [[L-System]]s. Node Rewriting operates on a grid of nodes typically in 2D or 3D space where the rules dictate what a node will be replaced with. The image below demonstrates this quite well, although it only shows one type of node where multiple types could be used, these nodes could have properties, etc, etc.

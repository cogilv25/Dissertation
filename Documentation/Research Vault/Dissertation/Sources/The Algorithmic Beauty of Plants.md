The book is a general summary of the work done on using L-Systems to generate plants written by someone who has been involved with the research area since the 70's or 80's(Fact Check). A large number of concepts are introduced:
- DOL-Systems - Stateless and deterministic, the basic L-System
- Turtle renderer - An actor based rendering technique
- 3 Dimensional turtle rendering using matrix mathematics and an extended turtle language
- Stochastic L-Systems where multiple rules can be provided with the same replaced symbol alongside a weight, then a random number is generated to choose which rule to use based off the weights
	- It is also mentioned that it is possible to add random variation within the turtle renderer as well
- 
### Notes
- It is mentioned that many interesting curves can be created by using multiple symbols to represent a draw operation when using a turtle renderer by assigning different production rules to the symbols. More specifically what is being spoken about is 2 symbols named F with the subscript l and r respectively to denote left versus right.. This seems confusing at first but the subscript is ignored by the turtle and only affects which production rules are applied to the symbol. TODO: Screenshot pg 11. 

### Criticism


### Quotes


### Thoughts on Usage
- Heavy usage in Introduction as this composes the main reference for the entire project.
- Very plant heavy so possibly not that useful for the literature review since we are going to mostly be staying away from plants due to the extensive body of research that already exists..

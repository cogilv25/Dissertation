Adds Global constraints to the original algorithm as well as native production of multiple layers, which was a criticism made of the original algorithm, however, I feel this was such a simple change as to be considered obvious and unimportant by the original [[Wave Function Collapse]] algorithm's author. Adds QOL features such as automatic calculation of symmetrically derivable rules.

Global Constraint Examples:
- Minimum / Maximum number of tiles top generate
- Distance constraints between types of tile

This is my Obsidian vault used for keeping track of research and areas of interest. To see it as intended you need to download [Obsidian](https://www.poo.com) and open this folder as a vault from within Obsidian. Using GitHub is fine but you will not get the interlinking of notes as intended and inter-file linking may not work as expected. This file was specifically altered to make it cross-compatible with Obsidian and GitHub Markdown.
# Structure
Bin contains images, etc that are included as in notes and is just to keep these out of the directory structure.
## Tags
The notes are separated into different types by tags which are set to display as different colours in the graph view which can be accessed by clicking on ![the three inter-connected nodes icon](Bin/graph_icon.png) in the upper left corner of obsidian.
## Graph View
This is intended as the main way to consume the research contained within the vault. It shows the connections of all the notes which allows papers to be broken down into concepts, metrics and algorithms and then these can be inter-linked to show related sources(papers, books, articles) as well as being linked to:
- What asset classes they could be used to generate.
- What experimental methods they have inspired.
- How they may be used in the final report.
# Conclusion
The main purpose of the vault is to allow me to keep track of my research and experiments and also be able to see how these inter-link which should be very useful when creating my final report.

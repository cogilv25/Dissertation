This paper uses L-Systems as a game mechanic. The L-Systems generate trees that have a random number of poisonous branches releasing toxic fumes to damage a player who has to use these branches to navigate an environment. The player can control the growth of the L-Systems and branches can fall off and continue to grow on their own (presumably attaching themselves to the ground in some fashion). The concept is that players must carefully plan when to grow L-Systems without full knowledge due to the randomness of the poisonous branches and branches falling to navigate their environment (Fornander, 2013).
### Criticism
The game mechanic doesn't seem to have a lot of depth and feels somewhat under-developed, having said that I currently can't forsee how this could be extended to better utilize the unique properties of L-Systems! My only real sense of direction here is that somehow the self-similarity property might be usable to produce a unique and engaging mechanic ([[Self-Similarity Based Mechanic]]).
### Thoughts on Usage
- Could be used as one of the few examples of using an L-System as a gameplay mechanic.
- Could be used as a starting point for generating a similar concept.

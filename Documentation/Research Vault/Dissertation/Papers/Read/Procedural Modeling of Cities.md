This paper presents a method for generating large scale cities composed of a road network and buildings using [[Extended L-Systems]]. [[Parametric L-System]]s are allowed to run producing a template, the parameters of the produced L-System are then modified externally to comply with a set of global goals (non-essential but desired) and then these are finally modified by a set of local constraints (essential, e.g. "building can't be on water"). This allows the output to be modified by changing these constraints without modifying the actual L-Systems.
### Thoughts on Usage
- Most likely used to justify not pursuing City generation as this paper and the following work by Pascal MÃ¼ller extensively covers this area of research and the software he produced and it's derivatives are extensively used in movies and games.
- The technique outlined in this paper (I believe there is another paper which coined this as "[[Functional L-System]]" which I prefer and will have to find) sounds very promising and I can see uses for it in the generation of other assets where loose artistic control is desired (Items, Terrain (impose limits on how rough or similar neighbouring points are), ) .
### Further Work
There were a few papers released later that built upon this research which I will list here as I work through them:

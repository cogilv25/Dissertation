A title will more than likely be undecided until some results have been gathered and a general viewpoint is formed about the conclusions to be made by the dissertation, however, there have been some thoughts and it's good to keep records to look back on!

- Where Have L-Systems Been Under-Utilized in 3D Games?
	  This was the title used for the proposal, there is a question of how do you empirically answer this question, what measurements do you use, you would need to somehow show that L-Systems had not been used in a specific area where you have then found uses, which would be difficult to do.
- How Could L-Systems be Implemented to Generate Better Worlds
	  Proposed by Magnus during proposal feedback as an alternative to get around this issue, where direct comparison of the output of the techniques being compared could be performed. I believe this could be a good alternative to solve this problem.

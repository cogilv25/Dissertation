Ok, so what are we doing here?

I'm thinking I will review/summarize each paper in a note, maybe take some notes about referenced papers that seem interesting and as I build up a collection of notes I can link back to previous papers to form a graph in the graph view of related ideas and where they come from... we'll see but that would be very useful in theory for writing my Introduction and Literature Review!

"organized" list of papers is [here](Sources.md)

Original paper introducing the [[Turtle Renderer]]. This turtle uses the standard set of 2D commands ( F, f, +, -, |, \[, \]). An extension mentioned is using curly braces to declare a set of edges as those of a polygon to be filled which is interesting.

### Notes
### Thoughts on Usage
Fairly Obviously will be incorporated into the background section of the dissertation, introducing the concept of a turtle.
